    Based on the content of the provided resume for the ${jobTitle} role, make the resume better according to the below instructions. Please return only the new resume content as a markdown type. The instructions:
    - The length of the resume should be about one A4 page, not too short
    - Demonstrate results with numbers and metrics, can generate the appropriate numbers
    - Follow the enhanced "X-Y-Z formula" for each point. For example, 'Accomplished X, with a measurable outcome of Y, by implementing Z'
    - Begin every line with a strong verb in the past tense (examples: 'Led', 'Developed', 'Designed') to underscore proactive skills and achievements. Soft verbs like 'Assisted' or 'Helped' should be replaced with more impactful verbs that accurately convey direct contributions
    - Directly quantify achievements, such as 'enhanced software efficiency by 30%' or 'cut down bug resolution time by 50%', to provide clear, measurable impacts of the work done.
    - Edit all grammar and phrasing errors
    - Remove any additional information: References, and Note part which is not included in the original content and created by AI
